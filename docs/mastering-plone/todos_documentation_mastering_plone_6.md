```{todo}
- Replace `mr.bob` with `plonecli`
- fill in meta data
- distinction: build for `training.plone.org` and presentation during training
- `embed` Do we want training.votable as a dependency? What about this magic event handler on auto publishing talks`? maybe replace by a more real life event handler.
- `anatomy` is referenced in `mastering-plone/code.md:89`, but does not exist
